# Google Play RTDN

## Overview

Google Play RTDN leverage the use of [Google Cloud Pub/Sub](https://cloud.
google.com/pubsub/) to send real-time notifications that allows you to react
immediately to changes in the subscription state, avoiding the need to poll
the API.

To receive notifications, you need to create a backend server to consume the
messages sent to your topic. This is provided out of the box by **LIAP**.

To use Cloud Pub/Sub, you must have a Google Cloud Platform project with
Cloud Pub/Sub enabled. Check the [Quickstart guide](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/quickstart-console)
for more information.

## Setup

The following steps are required to receive notifications:

- Create a topic.
- Create Pub/Sub a subscription.
- Grant the service account permission to publish messages to the topic.
- Enable Real-time developer notifications for your app.

### Create a topic

To create a topic, you can use the [Guide me](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloudpubsub?walkthrough_id=pubsub_quickstart)
feature provided by Google that guides you through the process of creating a
topic.

Or you can use the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloudpubsub/topicList),
which is a simple interface for managing topics.

Then Click on the **Create a topic** button. In the **Topic ID** field,
enter a unique ID for your topic, then click **Save**.

### Create a Pub/Sub subscription

To receive messages from the topic, you need to create a subscription to
that topic. To create a subscription, do the following:

1. Display the menu for the topic you just created.
2. Click on the **Create a subscription** button.
3. Type the name of the subscription.
4. Choose **Push to endpoint** as the delivery Type.
5. Enter the [URL of the backend server](http://localhost:3000/laravel-iap-docs/docs/get-started/routing#generate-a-signed-url)
you created in the **Endpoint URL**.
6. Click on the **Create** button.

### Grant publish rights on your topic

Google Pub/Sub requires that you grant Google Play the permission to publish
notifications to your topic. To do this:

1. Find your topic in the Google Cloud Console.
2. Open the permissions details.

5. In the **Topic name** field, enter the name of the topic you created. It
should be in the format `projects/{project_id}/topics/{topic_name}`.
6. Click **Save changes**.

:::warning Warning:::
Sending a **Test Message** requires a deployed endpoint to receive the
message, otherwise the message will keep trying to be sent.
:::

Test messages are logged by LIAP out of the box, so you can see the messages
in the logs.
